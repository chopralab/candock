How to compile:

cmake . -Bbuild
cd build
make candock

For release compile (with optimization):

cmake3 . -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Note: CANDOCK's build system now downloads and builds GSL and OpenMM automatically and
if you choose to use this feature, make sure you set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as these 
packages whish to install themselves before the CANDOCK build begins.

cmake3 . -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/directory/I/have/access/to
