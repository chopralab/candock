# FindOPENMM
# --------
#
# Find the native OPENMM includes and libraries.
#
# The GNU Scientific Library (OPENMM) is a numerical library for C and C++
# programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public
# License.
#
# Imported Targets
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If OPENMM is found, this module defines the following :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED`
# targets::
#
#  OPENMM::openmm      - The main OPENMM library.
#
# Result Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module will set the following variables in your project::
#
#  OPENMM_FOUND          - True if OPENMM found on the local system
#  OPENMM_INCLUDE_DIRS   - Location of OPENMM header files.
#  OPENMM_LIBRARIES      - The OPENMM libraries.
#
# Hints
# ^^^^^
#
# Set ``OPENMM_ROOT_DIR`` to a directory that contains a OPENMM installation.
#
# This script expects to find libraries at ``$OPENMM_ROOT_DIR/lib`` and the OPENMM
# headers at ``$OPENMM_ROOT_DIR/include/``.  The library directory may
# optionally provide Release and Debug folders.
#
# Cache Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module may set the following variables depending on platform and type
# of OPENMM installation discovered.  These variables may optionally be set to
# help this module find the correct files::
#
#  OPENMM_LIBRARY             - Location of the OPENMM library.
#  OPENMM_LIBRARY_DEBUG       - Location of the debug OPENMM library (if any).
